# hello-world
Hi everyone I'm excited to be here but also nervous. I know this is supposed to be an informational file about things in the repo lol but this is my first one and so I just wanted to give a little introduction. I will primarily be focusing on python projects in the near future and I have lots to learn and hopefully I have more to share as time goes on.
